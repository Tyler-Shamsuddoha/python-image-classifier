# Image Classifier using Python and Tensorflow
The final project for COMP 309 Machine Learning Tools and Techniques, using Keras and Tensorflow for Victoria University of Wellington. This Image Classifier was able to effectively
distinguish between strawberries, cherries and tomatoes with good accuracy.

Summary report and discussion along with preprocessing, hyper-parameter tuning, optimisation and all the good stuff is located in the final report <b>Report309_shamsutyle.pdf<b>

I really enjoyed this project, it was a great way to end a great course on machine learning and AI.
